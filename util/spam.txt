Dear Falling Fruit User,

<p>We haven't written our users for more than three years. It's our policy to email you as little as possible. However, we're writing now because we have a few very important things to tell you about:</p>

<strong>## Research on Urban Foraging with SUNY</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>We are reaching out to see if you'd be interested in participating in a brief survey on foraging trends. Your participation is voluntary and you can withdraw from the survey at any time. The results of this research survey, administered by State University of New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry, will be used to better understand urban foraging trends and our use of technology for urban foraging. We're excited about this research collaboration and growing interest in understanding foraging behavior in academic circles. We will not associate your name or contact information with any responses to the survey.</p>

<p>If you're interested in participating, please visit this link:<br>
