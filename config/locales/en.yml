      unverified_help: Sources are marked as unverified if their identity, location, or existence is disputed. Many sources imported from tree inventories are marked as unverified because their edibility is uncertain (for example, "Pear" could be either an edible or decorative variety). Users are encouraged to travel to these locations and report their findings.
      pending_types_help: We enforce a taxonomy of edible types to keep the map organized and searchable. Novel types submitted by users are highlighted as pending until they are either approved as a new type or merged with an existing type in the taxonomy. In rare instances when the submission is either too random or vague to warrant its own type, it persists on the map in an unapproved state.

      splash_html: Falling Fruit is a massive, collaborative map of the urban harvest. Uniting the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere, the map already points to over a half million food-producing locations around the world (from plants and fungi to water wells and dumpsters). Our rapidly growing user community is actively exploring, editing, and adding to the map.<br/><br/>Join us in celebrating the overlooked bounty of our city streets! Use the site anonymously or <a href="/users/sign_up">sign up</a> for an account to access additional features.
      freegan_splash_html: In addition to our efforts mapping the <a href="/">edible plants growing in cities</a>, we''ve set out to map the world's food-bearing dumpsters. Nearly 50% of all food produced in the developed world is never eaten. We''re hoping to raise awareness around this issue, facilitate the liberation of discarded food, and encourage businesses to <a href=\"/sharing\">donate the food</a> instead.<br><br>In support of a lower-waste lifestyle, we are encouraging the mapping of all locations (from dumpsters to free boxes) with discarded but useful goods, whether edible or otherwise.

      contact_us_html: Falling Fruit is built by and for foragers &ndash; we want it to be the best tool available to the contemporary forager. Write us at <a href="mailto:feedback@fallingfruit.org">feedback@fallingfruit.org</a>, we would love to hear from you!
      about_the_site: About the site
      celebration: Falling Fruit is a celebration of the overlooked culinary bounty of our city streets. By quantifying this resource on a map, we hope to facilitate intimate connections between people, food, and the natural organisms growing in our neighborhoods. Not just a free lunch! Foraging in the 21st century is an opportunity for urban exploration, to fight the scourge of stained sidewalks, and to reconnect with the botanical origins of food.
      join_us_html: Join us in celebrating the local and edible! The <a href="/">map</a> is open for anyone to edit, the database can be <a href="/data">downloaded</a> with just one click, and <a href="https://github.com/somerandomsequence/falling-fruit">the code</a> is open-source. You are likewise encouraged to share the bounty with your fellow humans. Our <a href="/sharing">sharing page</a> lists hundreds of local organizations - planting public orchards and food forests, picking otherwise-wasted fruits and vegetables from city trees and farmers' fields, and sharing with neighbors and the needy.
      more_about_html: Our map of urban edibles is not the first of its kind, but we aspire to be the world''s most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. The <a href=\"/datasets\">imported datasets</a> range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. This so far amounts to %{types} different types of edibles (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over %{locations} locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to the exotic flavors of foreign plants and the long-forgotten culinary uses of native plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.
      about_us: About us
      caleb_bio_html: Caleb is a featherless bipedal humanoid passionate about food justice and finding creative ways to use technology to address social issues. When he''s not biking around gawking at trees, he balances his efforts between his day job as a computer science professor at the <a href="http://cs.colorado.edu">University of Colorado</a> where he does research, as a consultant mostly in the field of mapping wireless network coverage, and as a worker bee for a number of nonprofit organizations (<a href="http://www.growbiointensive.org/">Ecology Action</a> in the San Francisco Bay Area, <a href="http://boulderfoodrescue.org">Boulder Food Rescue</a> in Boulder, Colorado). Besides all that work stuff, he likes to climb rocks, run trails, ride bikes, and generally be outdoors as much as possible.
      ethan_bio_html: From apple ciders and fruit beers to jams and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumtopf">Rumtopf</a>, Ethan looks to his database of neighborhood trees (and his rickety apple press) for culinary inspiration. While at home in Boulder, he geeks out over maps, data, and time-lapse of retreating glaciers for his PhD at the <a href="http://instaar.colorado.edu/people/ethan-welty/">University of Colorado</a>, but he often leaves his local orbit to walk, talk, eat, and photograph his way across continents.
      jeff_bio_html: Since harvesting black and blueberries with his family as a child and, more recently, noticing the wealth of public fruit trees throughout Colorado, Jeff has developed a deep appreciation for the abundance of fruit growing in our cities. His first mission for Falling Fruit was to comb Boulder and Salt Lake City, paper maps in-hand, to record fruiting trees. When not working to improve building energy efficiency, he is usually helping out in the community or moving quickly over mountains by foot, ski, or bicycle.
      closing_remarks: Closing Remarks
      closing_remarks_para1_html: Falling Fruit is a 501(c)(3) (tax-exempt) public charity registered in Boulder, Colorado. As a result, donations within the United States are tax deductible. You may review our <a href="/501c3.pdf">letter of exemption</a> from the IRS and verify our standing with <a href="http://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do?">IRS Publication 78</a> or the <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/BusinessEntityCriteriaExt.do?resetTransTyp=Y">Colorado Secretary of State</a>.

      closing_remarks_para2_html: Harvesting food in an urban setting comes with certain practical and moral considerations. For an introduction to the ethics of urban foraging, we recommend the excellent summary on our sibling site - Portland, Oregon''s <a href="http://urbanedibles.org/project/ethics">Urban Edibles</a>.
      closing_remarks_para3_html: Most of the foraging maps migrated to Falling Fruit were hosted on public Google Maps pages on which it was all too easy to accidentally move markers. If an address provided in a description disagrees with the location on the map, the marker was likely moved accidentally on the original map. Please update the locations of these markers accordingly whenever field inspection determines the address (and not the mapped location) to be correct.
      closing_remarks_para4_html: Municipal tree inventories are updated only gradually (if at all) as trees are visited for maintenance. User-contributed and municipal data may be several years old or plain wrong, so be prepared to encounter puzzling inaccuracies in the field. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to determine the identity, edibility, and location of a plant.
    data:
      intro: Falling Fruit is built on public data and the generosity of urban foragers willing to share their finds with others. We want urban food sources to reach as many people as possible, and we believe that everyone should have equal access to the fruits of our collective labor. In the spirit of open data, behold! The entire database

      data_unavailable_html: Data currently unavailable. Check back later or <a href="mailto:info@fallingfruit.org">contact us</a>.
      beware_html: But beware. Once uncompressed, the data becomes a huge file that causes most spreadsheet software to implode. Only those interested in manipulating the data in it\'s entirety need to go this route. For most, a better alternative is to selectively retrieve points of interest using the download tool integrated into the <a href="/">map</a>.
      license_html: If you are interested in using the data in your own project, especially for commercial applications, we suggest you contact us (<a href="mailto:info@fallingfruit.org">info@fallingfruit.org</a>). When not otherwise specified, data is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/deed.en_US">Creative Commons (Attribution, Non-commercial, Share-alike)</a> license. This means that you are free to use and distribute the data so long as you preserve the original author/source attribution and do not use it (without permission) for commercial applications. The source code for Falling Fruit is also open. More details on that can be found on <a href="https://github.com/somerandomsequence/falling-fruit">our github repository</a>.
      caveat_emptor_html: It should go without saying that we take no responsibility for the accuracy of the data - it is provided as is, <i>caveat emptor</i>. If you do something cool with the data, please <a href="mailto:feedback@fallingfruit.org">let us know</a>!

    datasets:
      intro_html: Falling Fruit aspires to be the world''s most comprehensive and open geographic dataset of urban edibles. While our users explore, edit, and add locations using our <a href=\"/\">map</a>, we comb the known universe for pre-existing datasets and import them directly into the <a href=\"/data\">database</a>, uniting the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. If you know of a dataset we''ve missed, please <a href=\"mailto:info@fallingfruit.org\">let us know</a>! You can also help us with the import process by formatting the data using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiHNFwLuWHvtdGVPamU2M0FZNFhpVTVSNXUtN3ZjRmc&usp=sharing">import template</a>. Note that since imports must be performed manually, further changes to the original data are not reflected on Falling Fruit.
      imported_datasets: Imported datasets
      types_of_data: Datasets imported to Falling Fruit fall into two main categories. "Community maps" are built by foragers and freegans as they peruse their surroundings for things to eat. We are indebted to the hardworking citizen-cartographers who have compiled this data. "Tree inventories" are compiled by cities, universities, and other institutions wishing to better document and care for their trees. We mine these vast datasets for food-producing species and add them to the map. To help us get your neighborhood on the map, contact your school or city urging them to share their tree inventory with us.
      table_info: Each dataset is listed by name, number of locations, and date imported. Expanding each row reveals further details about the original data, the import process, and the license governing how the data may be used.
