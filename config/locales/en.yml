      !binary "dW52ZXJpZmllZF9oZWxw": Sources are marked as unverified if their identity, location, or existence is disputed. Many sources imported from tree inventories are marked as unverified because their edibility is uncertain (for example, "Pear" could be either an edible or decorative variety). Users are encouraged to travel to these locations and report their findings.
      !binary "cGVuZGluZ190eXBlc19oZWxw": We enforce a taxonomy of edible types to keep the map organized and searchable. Novel types submitted by users are highlighted as pending until they are either approved as a new type or merged with an existing type in the taxonomy. In rare instances when the submission is either too random or vague to warrant its own type, it persists on the map in an unapproved state.

These data are typically collected by trained arborists and are both detailed and exhaustive. We carefully pick out edible species from these inventories and add them to the map for you. You can help us map your neighborhood by asking your city or university if a tree inventory exists and whether  it can be shared with Falling Fruit.
