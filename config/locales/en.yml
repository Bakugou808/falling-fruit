Novel types submitted by users are highlighted on the map as pending until they are added to the taxonomy or merged with an existing type. Some proposed types are so unique or ambiguous that they persist as unapproved indefinitely.
      unverified_help: Sources are marked as unverified if their identity, location, or existence is disputed. Many sources imported from tree inventories are marked as unverified because their edibility is uncertain (for example, "Pear" could be either an edible or decorative variety). Users are encouraged to travel to these locations and report their findings.

Nearly half of all food produced in the developed world is never eaten. We're hoping to raise awareness around food waste, facilitate the liberation of discarded food, and encourage businesses to <a href="/sharing?locale=en">donate their food</a> instead.<br/><br/>In support of a lower-waste lifestyle, we are encouraging the mapping of all freegan sources (from dumpsters to free boxes) with discarded but useful goods, edible or otherwise.

These data are typically collected by trained arborists and are both detailed and exhaustive. We carefully pick out edible species from these inventories and add them to the map for you. Help us map your neighborhood by asking your city (or university, canton, etc) if a tree inventory exists and whether it can be shared on Falling Fruit.

      celebration: Falling Fruit is a celebration of the overlooked culinary bounty of our city streets. By quantifying this resource on an interactive map, we hope to facilitate intimate connections between people, food, and the natural organisms growing in our neighborhoods. Not just a free lunch! Foraging in the 21st century is an opportunity for urban exploration, to fight the scourge of stained sidewalks, and to reconnect with the botanical origins of food.
      closing_remarks: Closing remarks
      closing_remarks_para1_html: Falling Fruit is a 501(c)(3) (tax-exempt) public charity based in Boulder, Colorado. As a result, donations within the United States are tax deductible. You may review our <a href="/501c3.pdf">letter of exemption</a> from the IRS and verify our standing with <a href="http://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do?">IRS Publication 78</a> or the <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/BusinessEntityCriteriaExt.do?resetTransTyp=Y">Colorado Secretary of State</a>.

      closing_remarks_para2_html: Harvesting food in an urban setting comes with certain practical and moral considerations. For an introduction to the ethics of urban foraging, we recommend the excellent summary on our sibling site - Portland, Oregon's <a href="http://urbanedibles.org/project/ethics">Urban Edibles</a>.
      closing_remarks_para3_html: Information on Falling Fruit may be wrong or out of date. For example, many of the foraging maps migrated to Falling Fruit were hosted as public Google Maps on which markers were often moved accidentally, and municipal tree inventories are updated only (if ever) as trees are visited for maintenance. Be prepared to encounter inaccuracies in the field, and please edit the map as needed based on your discoveries. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to determine the identity, edibility, and location of a plant, and the responsibility of all to improve the quality of the map.
      contact_us_html: Falling Fruit is built by and for foragers â we want it to be the best tool available to the contemporary forager. Write us at <a href="mailto:feedback@fallingfruit.org">feedback@fallingfruit.org</a>, we would love to hear from you!

      jeff_bio_html: Since harvesting black and blueberries with his family as a child and, more recently, noticing the wealth of public fruit trees throughout Colorado, Jeff has developed a deep appreciation for the abundance of fruit growing in our cities. His first mission for Falling Fruit was to comb Boulder and Salt Lake City, paper maps in-hand, to record fruiting trees. When not working to improve building energy efficiency, he is usually helping out in the community or moving quickly over mountains by foot, ski, or bicycle.
      join_us_html: Join us in celebrating hyper-local food! The <a href="/?locale=en">map</a> is open for anyone to edit, the database can be <a href="/data?locale=en">downloaded</a> with just one click, and <a href="https://github.com/somerandomsequence/falling-fruit">the code</a> is open-source. You are likewise encouraged to share the bounty with your fellow humans. Our <a href="/sharing?locale=en">sharing page</a> lists hundreds of local organizations - planting public orchards and food forests, picking otherwise-wasted fruits and vegetables from city trees and farmers' fields, and sharing with neighbors and the needy.
      more_about_html: Our edible map is not the first of its kind, but it aspires to be the world's most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. The <a href="/datasets?locale=en">imported datasets</a> range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. This so far amounts to %{types} different types of edibles (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over %{locations} locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to the exotic flavors of foreign plants and long-forgotten native plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.

      tristram_stuart_bio_html: ! 'As a teenager, Tristram raised pigs on surplus food that he collected from his school kitchens, the local baker and village greengrocer. Noticing that a lot of this food was still suitable for human consumption led him to the realisation that good, fresh food was being wasted on a colossal scale. Tristram has since worked tirelessly to bring this issue to the attention of the public, the media, and policy-makers. He founded the food waste campaign organization <a href="//feedbackglobal.org">Feedback Global</a> and wrote <a href="//tristramstuart.co.uk/">Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scandal</a> to demonstrate the extent of the problem on a global scale. In 2011, Tristram was awarded <a href="//www.sofieprisen.no/Prize_Winners/2011/index.html">The Sophie Prize</a> for his fight against food waste.'

      intro_html: Falling Fruit aspires to be the most comprehensive and open geographic dataset of urban edibles. While our users explore, edit, and add locations using our <a href="/?locale=en">map</a>, we comb the known universe for pre-existing datasets and import them directly into the <a href="/data?locale=en">database</a>, uniting the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. If you know of a dataset we've missed, please <a href="mailto:info@fallingfruit.org">let us know</a>! You can also help us with the import process by formatting the data using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiHNFwLuWHvtdGVPamU2M0FZNFhpVTVSNXUtN3ZjRmc&usp=sharing">import template</a>. Note that since imports must be performed manually, all changes to the original data made after the import are not reflected on Falling Fruit.

      table_info: Each dataset is listed by name, number of locations, and date imported. Expanding each row reveals further details about the original data, the import process, and the license governing how the data may be used.

      types_of_data: Datasets imported into Falling Fruit fall into two main categories. "Community maps" are built by foragers and freegans as they peruse their communities for things to eat. We are indebted to the hardworking citizen-cartographers who have compiled this data. "Tree inventories" are compiled by cities, universities, and other institutions wishing to better document and care for their trees. We mine these vast datasets for food-producing species and add them to the map. To help us map your neighborhood fruit trees, contact your school or city urging them to share their tree inventory with us.
    sharing:
      food_banks: Food banks
      food_banks_intro: Foragers and private tree owners are encouraged to donate their surplus produce to charity. Consider partnering with groups like those listed above, or donating directly to organizations feeding the hungry in your community. The major food bank networks are listed below; homeless shelters, schools, and senior centers are also worth considering.
      grow_pick_and_distribute: Grow Â· Pick Â· Distribute
      intro_html: Listed below are organizations that grow food in public urban spaces (food forests, public orchards), pick food (urban foraging, farm gleaning), or distribute food (swaps, donations). Organizations are listed by country, state (if applicable), and city. Those with crossed-out names are believed to be inactive. If you know of others that should be on this list, <a href="mailto:info@fallingfruit.org">contact us</a>!
