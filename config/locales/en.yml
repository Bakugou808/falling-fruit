Many sources imported from tree inventories are marked as unverified because their edibility is uncertain (for example, "Pear" could be either an edible or decorative variety). Users are encouraged to travel to these locations and report their findings.
      !binary "cGVuZGluZ190eXBlc19oZWxw": We enforce a taxonomy of edible types to keep the map organized and searchable. Novel types submitted by users are highlighted as pending until they are either approved as a new type or merged with an existing type in the taxonomy. In rare instances when the submission is either too random or vague to warrant its own type, it persists on the map in an unapproved state.

      !binary "Y2VsZWJyYXRpb24=": Falling Fruit is a celebration of the overlooked culinary bounty of our city streets. By quantifying this resource on a map, we hope to facilitate intimate connections between people, food, and the natural organisms growing in our neighborhoods. Not just a free lunch! Foraging in the 21st century is an opportunity for urban exploration, to fight the scourge of stained sidewalks, and to reconnect with the botanical origins of food.
      join_us_html: Join us in celebrating the local and edible! The <a href="/">map</a> is open for anyone to edit, the database can be <a href="/data">downloaded</a> with just one click, and <a href="https://github.com/somerandomsequence/falling-fruit">the code</a> is open-source. You are likewise encouraged to share the bounty with your fellow human beings. Our <a href="/sharing">sharing page</a> lists hundreds of local organizations planting food forests and public orchards, picking otherwise-wasted fruits and vegetables from city trees and farmers'' fields, and swapping with and giving to neighbors and the needy.
      !binary "bW9yZV9hYm91dF9odG1s": Our map of urban edibles is not the first of its kind, but we aspire to be the world''s most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. The <a href=\"/datasets\">imported datasets</a> range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. This so far amounts to %{types} different types of edibles (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over %{locations} locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to the exotic flavors of foreign plants and the long-forgotten culinary uses of native plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.
      !binary "YWJvdXRfdXM=": About us
      !binary "Y2FsZWJfYmlvX2h0bWw=": Caleb is a featherless bipedal humanoid passionate about food justice and finding creative ways to use technology to address social issues. When he''s not biking around gawking at trees, he balances his efforts between his day job as a computer science professor at the <a href="http://cs.colorado.edu">University of Colorado</a> where he does research, as a consultant mostly in the field of mapping wireless network coverage, and as a worker bee for a number of nonprofit organizations (<a href="http://www.growbiointensive.org/">Ecology Action</a> in the San Francisco Bay Area, <a href="http://boulderfoodrescue.org">Boulder Food Rescue</a> in Boulder, Colorado). Besides all that work stuff, he likes to climb rocks, run trails, ride bikes, and generally be outdoors as much as possible.
      !binary "ZXRoYW5fYmlvX2h0bWw=": From apple ciders and fruit beers to jams and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumtopf">Rumtopf</a>, Ethan looks to his database of neighborhood trees (and his rickety apple press) for culinary inspiration. While at home in Boulder, he geeks out over maps, data, and time-lapse of retreating glaciers for his PhD at the <a href="http://instaar.colorado.edu/people/ethan-welty/">University of Colorado</a>, but he often leaves his local orbit to walk, talk, eat, and photograph his way across continents.
      !binary "amVmZl9iaW9faHRtbA==": Since harvesting black and blueberries with family as a child and, more recently, noticing the wealth of public fruit trees throughout Colorado, Jeff has developed a deep appreciation for the abundance of fruit growing in our cities. His first mission for Falling Fruit was to comb Boulder and Salt Lake City, paper maps in-hand, to record fruiting trees. When not working to improve building energy efficiency, he is usually helping out in the community or moving quickly over mountains by foot, ski, or bicycle.

If you know of a dataset we''ve missed, please <a href=\"mailto:info@fallingfruit.org\">let us know</a>! You can also help us with the import process by formatting the data using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiHNFwLuWHvtdGVPamU2M0FZNFhpVTVSNXUtN3ZjRmc&usp=sharing">import template</a>. Note that since imports must be performed manually, further changes to the original data are not reflected on Falling Fruit.
      !binary "aW1wb3J0ZWRfZGF0YXNldHM=": Imported datasets
      !binary "dHlwZXNfb2ZfZGF0YQ==": Datasets imported to Falling Fruit fall into two main categories. "Community maps" are built by foragers and freegans as they peruse their surroundings for things to eat. We are indebted to the hardworking citizen-cartographers who have compiled this data. "Tree inventories" are compiled by cities, universities, and other institutions wishing to better document and care for their trees. We mine these vast datasets for food-producing species and add them to the map. To help us get your neighborhood on the map, contact your school or city urging them to share their tree inventory with us.
      !binary "dGFibGVfaW5mbw==": Each dataset is listed by name, number of locations, and date imported. Expanding each row reveals further details about the original data, the import process, and the license governing how the data may be used.
